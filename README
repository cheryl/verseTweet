# About

A hastily hacked together twitter bot.
Thanks to 360percents.com for the twitter api script in src/tweeter.sh (modified) :)

# Issues
* 140 characters at splitter is more than 140 characters according to tweeter
* some juggling with numbers in splitter - not quite sure what is happening, but at least it works
