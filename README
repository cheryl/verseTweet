# About

A semi-hastily hacked together twitter bot in bash for tweeting whole bible verses using the ESV.
Thanks to 360percents.com for the twitter api script in src/tweeter.sh (modified) :)

# Issues

* 140 characters at splitter is more than 140 characters according to tweeter
* some juggling with numbers in splitter - not quite sure what is happening, but at least it works
